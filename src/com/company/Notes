Jenkins:

What are Servers?
1) Stay power on all the tine
2) String internet connection(in DBps) all the time
3) A lot of resources like RAM disk ets

============================================================

1 - Developers will develop the code
2 - Runs the Unit test if everything goes well ask the DevOps person
to build that code and deploy the code on Dev server
3 - Developer verifies that code on the Dev server
4 - Request to DevOps person to deploy it on the integration server
5 - Tester will ask DevOps to deploy the code to a QA server
6 - Tester may ask again DevOps person deploy it on the Load(Performance)
server, Security testing servers
7 - DEvops person deploy application on Staging Servers
(replica of production servers) UAT server on which uat is performed
8 - To production server

Issues in the manual Testing/deployment
- Time consuming
- If multiple developers are working there can be issues to build and to
fix those issues we may need to look all of the newly added code
- No automation means a lot of manual effort
